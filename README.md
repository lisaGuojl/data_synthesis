# Data synthesis

### Run the data synthesis

```bash
python main.py --pis A --merge_gtin B --split_gtin C --split_pi D --same_pis E --sample_num F
```
A: a numeric string representing the point of interests in the path, it can contain the following numbers:
1: fishing company/vessel, 2: auction center; 3: logistic service provider; 4: processing factory; 
5: distribution center/wholesaler; 6: retailer.

B: a numeric string indicating the number of input gtins at each PI. It is used to control path merging. If B[i] = 0 
and A[i] != 4, it means the gtin will remain the same at A[i]. If B[i] =n (>1) and A[i] = 4 (or 5), it means the
CTE4 (or CTE 5) generated by A[i] will have n input gtins. 

C: a numeric string indicating the number of output gtins at each PI. Similar to B, but it is used to control path splitting.

D: a numeric string indicating the number of next PIs without the change of gtin. It is also used to control path splitting,
but the gtin will not be changed. If C[i] = n (>1) and A[i] = 2, it means that there are n consumers for the same gtin 
when initial sale. If C[i] = n (>1) and A[i] = 4 or 5, it means that the produces with the same gtin will be shipped to n consumers.

E: a bool value indicating whether the same PIs are used in the sub-paths.

F: a number representing the number of paths to be generated.

Note that A, B, C, D should have the same length.

Example:
```bash
python main.py --pis "123437" --merge_gtin "000200" --split_gtin "000100" --split_pi "000000" --same_pis False --sample_num 20
```
The path: 

![EXAPLE 1](./example1.png)

If --same_pis is True, then PI_11/PI_21/PI_31 and PI_12/PI_21/PI_31 will be the same.
